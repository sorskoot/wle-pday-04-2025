# Project Day Automation

A very simple automation game in Wonderland Engine

- Make sure Wonderland Code is complient with [the Wonderfully Consistant Guide](wonderland-instructions.md)
- For the UI we use [Wonderland React-UI](./wonderland-react-ui.md)
- The game is build using TypeScript.
- The game uses a custom React implementation for Wonderland Engine, REACT-DOM is not used.
- Everything, including the UI is rendered through Wonderland Engine.
- We can't use any other 3rd party libraries, other then what is already defined in Package.json
- Wonderland Engine uses ESBuild for building projects.
